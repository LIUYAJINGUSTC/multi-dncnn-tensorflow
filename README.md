# multi-dncnn-tensorflow
A TensorFlow implementation of "Multi-scale and multi-branch denoising convolution neural network). However, I just refer basic key ideas such as residual learning scheme and loss function and most of the network architecture is different from original paper and code.
# Requirements
Python 3.4, 3.5
TensorFlow >= 1.0.0
numpy, scipy, scikit-image
